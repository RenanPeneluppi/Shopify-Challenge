# Shopify-Challenge

In the folder "Shopify" you will find a PDF file for question two of the Challenge, containing the SQL code for the queries from W3Scholl web editor, and a Jupyter Notebook for the first question as I chose to solve it using Python.

The Jupyter notebook has the first section with my findings described to answer the questions and following that all my python coding.

Feel free to browse some of my other projects that are public on my GitHub home https://github.com/RenanPeneluppi
My Tour the France repository, for example, contains web scraping, feature engineering and machine learning examples of my work.
